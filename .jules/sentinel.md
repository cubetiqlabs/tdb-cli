## 2024-10-08 - API Key Exposure in CLI Config Output
**Vulnerability:** The raw configuration output commands (`tdb config show` and `tdb config list --raw`) were exposing raw API keys and the Admin Secret in plaintext without masking.
**Learning:** While the custom JSON serialization or YAML output handlers process the config objects, raw map printing and shallow copying allowed deep objects containing secrets to leak directly to `cmd.OutOrStdout()`.
**Prevention:** Always implement a dedicated `MaskedClone()` method for sensitive structures that performs deep copying of any nested maps and pointers containing credentials before marshalling for output.
